# Composite Data Types

Composite data types are types that can hold multiple pieces of data together. They are like containers that can store different values of different types as a single entity.

Think of a composite data type as a bag that can hold various items. Each item in the bag can be of a different type, such as numbers, strings, or even other composite data types. These composite data types allow you to organize and group related data together, making it easier to work with and manipulate complex structures.

There are different forms of composite data types, such as arrays, structures, and classes.

- [Arrays](#composite-data-types) are an ordered collection of elements of the same type. They allow you to store multiple values of the same data type, such as a list of numbers or a series of names.

- [Records](#composite-data-types) (or structures) are a way to combine different types of data into a single entity. For example, you can have a record that represents a person, with fields like name, age, and address.

- [Classes](#composite-data-types) are a more advanced form of composite data types, often used in object-oriented programming. They encapsulate both data and functions, allowing you to create objects with their own unique properties and behaviors.

Composite data types are essential in programming as they enable you to model and manipulate complex real-world concepts and relationships. They provide a way to organize and represent data in a structured manner, making code more efficient, modular, and easier to understand and maintain.


## Arrays

 Arrays in programming are a way to store and organize a collection of elements of the same data type. They allow you to group related data together under a single name, making it easier to work with and manipulate large amounts of data.

Imagine an array as a numbered list of boxes, where each box can hold a specific value. Each box in the list has an index number that indicates its position. You can access the values stored in the array by referring to their index numbers.

For example, let's say we have an array called `numbers` that stores a sequence of integers:

```
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

In this case, the array `numbers` has five elements: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. The first element, 2, is at index 0, the second element, 4, is at index 1, and so on.

To access or modify the elements of an array, you can use their corresponding index numbers. For example, to retrieve the value 6 from the array `numbers`, you would use `numbers[2]`, because 6 is at index 2.

Arrays are useful when you need to work with collections of data that have a similar nature or need to be processed together. They allow you to perform operations on multiple values simultaneously, such as calculating sums, finding maximum or minimum values, or sorting the elements in a specific order.

It's important to note that arrays in most programming languages have a fixed size, meaning you need to define the size of the array when you create it. However, some languages offer dynamic arrays that can grow or shrink as needed.

Arrays are a fundamental data structure in programming, and understanding how to work with them is essential for managing and manipulating data effectively.

## Records

A record is a basic data structure that allows data values of different types that relate to each other to be stored together instead of in different arrays ¹. For example, a record could be declared to hold the information about a board game: 

```
RECORD Boardgame 
    title 
    genre 
    numPlayers 
    minAge 
    maxAge 
ENDRECORD
```

This would create a record that stores the title and genre as strings and the number of players, minimum age, and maximum age as integers. Each board game would be created as a separate record which could then be held in an array, creating an array of records ¹.

Records are distinguished from arrays by the fact that their number of fields is determined in the definition of the record, and by the fact that records are a heterogeneous data type; not all of the fields must contain the same type of data ². A record type is a data type that describes such values and variables. Most modern computer languages allow the programmer to define new record types ².
